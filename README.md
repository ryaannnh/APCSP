# AP CSP C & Python Projects
All contents in this repository were created in 2023 as part of AP CSP coursework. They show my early experience with coding.

Smaller tasks practicing basic programming concepts culminated in the final project, where I designed a number-guessing game written in Python. 
For details, feel free to open each code file and read its description.

## Topics Covered
